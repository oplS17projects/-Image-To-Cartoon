# Pencil Posterizing

### Version: 0.3

### Team Member:
+ Duy Truong
+ Chuong Vu
### Overview

For Pencil Posterrizing Poject, our team used racket language to edit and create a new image from the original image. We have a lot different ways to convert (cartoon, gray, pencil). Our team focus on pencil posterizing. However, Our team also implement some extra filter can help the user can convert ti different type of image. 

### Analysis
An digital image is a contributed by millions pixel/dot. And each pixel is contain 3 values Reg/Green/Blue (RGB) and these value make a color. Our program is load every pixel (RGB) into a list of list (or we can say 2-dimension array or matrix x/y). The pixel in the matrix is represent each dot on the image so it help us easily keep track the color at the position x/y. By that, we can can change the color to anything we want and for this project, our goal it convert the image to cartoon/stretch image.
Our team try to use less the library of the racket, we implement new function base on the following algorithm:
* Invert Image
* Gray Scale
* Color Image Dodge Merge
* Poterzing Image

### Library
For the libary of the racket, Our team use only two library to edit the image.
* String - Using Sting libary to read and store the pixel of the image
* flomap - to make a `flomap` for generate the Gaussian Blur filter.
* draw make-pen make-color - support bitmap% different type object of bitmap. To convert from bitmap to flomap

### Deliverable and Demonstration
We successfully to convert from the original image to pencil image.

### Evaluation of Results
We are almost there, we are now searching for a good algorithm that do a filter, which it use to combine this filter and BW to create a new image.

* The BW image is very simple, it is made from gray value and gray value is the mean of RGB values.
* Filter, we are searching for a good algorithm now. There are many imageâ€™s filter such as Median Blur, Bilateral filter, Min filter. 

We may use Median Blur and redraw the image based on detect and enhance edges algorithm to create a new image.


## Architecture Diagram

![alt text][diagram]

1. Load the Input image
2. Read every pixel of the Image which are the RGB value and store it into 2D list.
3. Calculate gray values
4. Create filter
5. Combine gray values and filter
6. Create new image 


## Schedule

### First Milestone (Sun Apr 9)
- [x] Finished Posterizing Filter
- [x] Finished InvertColor Filter

We both will work on Gaussian Blur Filter. After that we will combine the filter and gray filter togeter to get the final image.

### Second Milestone (Sun Apr 16)
- [x] Got the Gaussian Blur filter works
- [x] Convert image to sketch.

At this point, we use another two racket library with is `(require images/flomap)` and `(require (except-in racket/draw make-pen make-color)).` to make a `flomap` for generate the Gaussian Blur filter.

### Public Presentation (Mon Apr 24, Wed Apr 26, or Fri Apr 28 [your date to be determined later])
- [ ] 
Wrap up everything, all bugs should be addressed. Clean up the code and ready to demonstrate.

## Group Responsibilities
